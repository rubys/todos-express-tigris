# Express • [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com), adapted for [fly.io](https://fly.io/)

This is a fork of [jaredhanson/todos-express-sqlite](https://github.com/jaredhanson/todos-express-sqlite), with the following modifications:

* `db.js` is modified to fetch an sqlite3 database from Tigris before every query,
  and to push the sqlite3 database to Tigris after every update.

With these changes multiple replicas of this application can be deployed, even
in multiple regions.  **Warning** no locking is in place so simultaneous
updates can result in updates becoming lost. 

# Express • [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

> Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

## Implementation

In contrast to a typical [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com) app, this app does not
utilize a frontend JavaScript framework or make use of client-side capabilities
such as `localStorage`.  Instead, it illustrates how to build a todo app using
a backend for application logic and persistence, along with HTML forms for
interaction.

This app is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) along with the [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
web framework.  Data is persisted to a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
database.  HTML pages are rendered using [EJS](https://ejs.co/) templates, and
are styled using vanilla CSS.  HTML forms are used to modify data, rather than a
RESTful API.  That being said, the forms serialize data in a format inspired by
[Todo-Backend](https://todobackend.com/).

To run this app, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jaredhanson/todos-express-sqlite.git
$ cd todos-express-sqlite
$ npm install
```

Then start the server:

```
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

The scaffolding for this app was generated using [Express application generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html):

```bash
$ express -v ejs todos-express-sqlite
```
